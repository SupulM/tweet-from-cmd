# tweet-from-cmd
A small project I did enabling the feature of posting a tweet to twitter using the command line. Used Twit twitter API client for node.

# How to run this program
Clone the git repository
Replace the access token fields with your own ones, you can get them at https://dev.twitter.com
Run node bot.js
